### DCB configuration

I trying to do the DCB configuration for `Ethernet controller: Intel Corporation 82599ES 10-Gigabit SFI/SFP+ Network Connection`, 
I know a little about DCB(Data Center Bridging) but it seems this DCB abd VMDQ(Virtual Machine Device Queue) are all together usually.
 There is a DPDK sample application configures DCP + VMQD together. It is located at `DPDK_ROOT/example/vmdq_dcb`, there is also a VMDQ only
 example at `DPDK_ROOT/example/vmdq_dcb`. For now I only intend to configure two traffic classes with DCB.

A sequence of commands comes handy and I want to keep them here!

My first trial is with the DPDK testpmd application, here is how I start my testpmd application:
1. sudo ./testpmd -l 0-8 -n 4 -- -i --portmask=0x1 --nb-cores=4
